# Cicly-know your cycle

Cicly is an educational website designed to provide clear, friendly, and accessible information about the menstrual cycle. The project aims to support young people, especially girls, who may not have someone to ask or trustworthy resources to rely on.

I created this website myself, First i designes the website and te mascot then i actualy built the site using html, CSS and Javascrit. I used ChatGT only to search for medical information about menstruation to post on the site. 

This was the first time I built something entirely from schract, and I have larned a lot especially about JavaScript.
