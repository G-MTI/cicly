          <h3>What is the menstrual cycle?</h3>
          <p>
            The menstrual cycle is the monthly hormonal process a woman's body goes through to prepare for a possible pregnancy. Regular menstrual periods in the years between puberty and menopause are usually a sign that your body is working normally. Irregular or heavy, painful periods are not normal. Many women also get premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms.

          <h3>What is menstruation?</h3>
          <p>
            Menstruation, or period, is normal vaginal bleeding that occurs as part of a woman's monthly cycle. Every month, your body prepares for pregnancy. If no pregnancy occurs, the uterus, or womb, sheds its lining. The menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from inside the uterus. It passes out of the body through the vagina.

          <h3>What is a “normal” cycle and period length?</h3>
          <p>
            A normal menstrual cycle ranges from 21 to 35 days, with bleeding typically lasting 2 to 7 days. For the first few years after menstruation begins, long cycles are common. However, menstrual cycles tend to shorten and become more regular as people age.

          <h3>What are the phases of the cycle?</h3>
          <p>
            The menstrual cycle consists of four main phases: menstrual (shedding of the uterine lining), follicular (egg maturation and uterine lining buildup), ovulation (release of an egg), and luteal (maintenance of the uterine lining).

          <h3>When does ovulation happen and what is the fertile window?</h3>
          <p>
            Ovulation typically occurs about 14 days before a woman's period begins. The fertile window is the period during which pregnancy is possible, usually spanning 5 days before ovulation and the day of ovulation.

          <h3>What is PMS, and how is it different from PMDD?</h3>
          <p>
            Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) involves physical and emotional symptoms before a period, while premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a more severe form with marked mood symptoms and functional impairment.

          <h3>What counts as an irregular cycle, and when should I see a clinician?</h3>
          <p>
            Cycles outside 21–35 days, bleeding longer than 7 days, very heavy flow, bleeding between periods, or missing 3 periods in a row warrant medical advice.

          <h3>Can you get pregnant during your period?</h3>
          <p>
            It’s less likely but possible—especially with short cycles or early ovulation—because sperm can survive for several days.

          <h3>What causes period pain and when is it concerning?</h3>
          <p>
            Cramping (dysmenorrhea) is common; severe, worsening, or prolonged pain can signal conditions like endometriosis or fibroids—seek care if pain is severe or lasts beyond a few days.

          <h3>What is amenorrhea (missing periods)?</h3>
          <p>
            Amenorrhea is absence of periods: primary (no first period by ~age 15) or secondary (periods stop for 3+ months in someone who previously menstruated). Some causes are normal (pregnancy, breastfeeding, menopause) while others need evaluation.

          <h3>At what ages do periods typically start and stop?</h3>
          <p>
            Menarche usually occurs around ages 12–13 (range varies); menopause typically occurs between 45–55, with an average near 51.

          <h3>What factors can affect cycle regularity?</h3>
          <p>
            Age (puberty, perimenopause), stress, significant weight change, intense exercise, some contraceptives, thyroid or PCOS and other health conditions can alter timing and flow.
